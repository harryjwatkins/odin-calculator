# odin-calculator

This project was to make a calculator with a GUI for the four basic operations using JavaScript/HTML/CSS. In this project I had to mostly use DOM manipulation and event listeners to listen for user clicks and grab the ID of the button pressed, to then use this on the "screen". <br  />

Possible future updates: <br  />
Add keyboard support to the calculator. Refactor the JavaScript to make it more readable. Perhaps split into more functions where I can. Could also possibly add more
maths functions, such as exponents.
